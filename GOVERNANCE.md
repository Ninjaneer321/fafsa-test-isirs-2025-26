# Governance
The goal of this project is to accelerate the successful processing of Institutional Student Information Records (ISIRs) for the 2025-26 FAFSA Award Year by our partners in higher education. We aim to do that by providing **test data** and **test tools** that support implementation of the official ISIR Specification. (See [2025â€“26 FAFSA Specifications Guide][fafsa_spec_2025_26])

 [fafsa_spec_2025_26]: https://fsapartners.ed.gov/knowledge-center/library/handbooks-manuals-or-guides/2024-08-23/2025-26-fafsa-specifications-guide-september-2024-update

Any contributions of test data or to the test tools will be reviewed especially for their accuracy and correctness. Please **do not use real personally identifiable information (PII)**, as your pull request may be rejected. Submitted test ISIRs will go through light validation and review, and may by modified before being publicly posted.

This project is governed by our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
